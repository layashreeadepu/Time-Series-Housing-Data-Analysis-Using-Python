# 🏠 Time-Series & Housing Data Analysis Using Python

This repository presents a time-series analysis of the U.S. housing market from 2000 to 2024, using data sourced from FRED and other online repositories. The study explores the interplay between **GDP**, **mortgage rates**, **housing supply**, and **average home prices**, leveraging Python for data processing and visualization.

## 📌 Project Highlights

* **Data Sources:** FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)
* **Tech Stack:** Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
* **Scope:** 2000–2024 U.S. housing and economic trends
* **Focus:** Impact of economic events (e.g., 2008 crash, COVID-19) on the housing market

## 📈 Key Visualizations

* **U.S. GDP Trend (2000–2024):** Correlation with housing price trends
* **Average House Prices:** Significant changes during financial crises and recovery periods
* **30-Year Fixed Mortgage Rates:** Relationship to housing affordability
* **Housing Supply (List/Sold Ratio):** Market shift indicators (buyer’s vs seller’s market)

---

## 🔍 Core Insights

* **Strong correlation (0.97)** between GDP growth and home price increases
* **Negative correlation (-0.32)** between mortgage rates and house prices
* **Housing supply** moderately affects prices, but **demand and economy** have stronger impacts
* **Major economic events** created clear trend shifts in housing patterns

## 📄 Summary

This analysis shows that the U.S. housing market is deeply influenced by macroeconomic indicators. GDP trends and mortgage rates play key roles in shaping housing prices and sales. While supply matters, demand-side factors—especially interest rates and income—are stronger drivers of long-term trends.
